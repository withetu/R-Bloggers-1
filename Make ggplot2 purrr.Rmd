# ==============================================

# Make ggplot2 purrr

# ==============================================



# To illustrate this idea, let’s use the data from the Penn World Tables 9.0. The easiest way to get this data is to install the package called pwt9 with:
install.packages("pwt9")
install.packages("pwt9")
library(pwt9)

# load the data
data("pwt9.0")

# Now, let’s load the needed packages. I am also using ggthemes which makes themeing your ggplots very easy. I’ll be making Tufte-style plots.
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(pwt9)


# First let’s select a list of countries:
country_list <- c("France", "Germany", "United States of America", "Luxembourg", "Switzerland", "Greece")

small_pwt <- pwt9.0 %>%
  filter(country %in% country_list)

#order the countries in the data frame
small_pwt <- small_pwt %>%
  mutate(country = factor(country, levels = country_list, ordered = TRUE))

# Now when you want to plot the same variable by countries, the usual way to do this is with one of facet_wrap() or facet_grid():
g <- ggplot(data = small_pwt)
g + theme_tufte() +
  geom_line(aes(y = avh, x = year)) +
  facet_wrap(~country)

g + theme_tufte() + 
  geom_line(aes(y = avh, x = year)) +
  facet_grid(country~.)

# use of dplyr::do()
plots <- small_pwt %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  do(plot = ggplot(data = .) + theme_tufte() +
       geom_line(aes(y = avh, x = year))+
       ggtitle(unique(.$country)) + 
       ylab("Year") +
       xlab("Average annual hours worked by persons engaged"))

print(plots)

# Here are the final lines that use purrr::map2() to save all these plots at once inside your working directory:
file_names <- paste0(country_list, ".pdf")
map2(file_names, plots$plot, ggsave)
