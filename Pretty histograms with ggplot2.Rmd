# Basic Histogram
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(d, aes(x)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Adding Colour

#we fill the bars with the same variable (x) but cut into multiple categories:
ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) +
  geom_histogram()
#Oh, ggplot2 has added a legend for each of the 100 groups created by cut! Get rid of this with show.legend = FALSE:
ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE)


#here weâ€™ll tweak the colours to range from blue to red, using "scale_fill_discrete"
ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_discrete(h = c(240, 10))


#Seems a little dark. Tweak chroma and luminance with c and l:Seems a little dark. Tweak chroma and luminance with c and l:
ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_discrete(h = c(240, 10), c = 120, l = 70)


#The final touches are to set the theme, add labels, and a title:
ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_discrete(h = c(240, 10), c = 120, l = 70) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Variable X", y = "n") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of X")


#Now have fun tweaking the colours!
p <- ggplot(d, aes(x, fill = cut(x, 100))) + 
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Variable X", y = "n") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of X")

p + scale_fill_discrete(h = c(180, 360), c = 150, l = 80)
p + scale_fill_discrete(h = c(90, 210), c = 30, l = 50)
