# Load the economics data from ggplot2

# Take a look at the format of the data

# Create the plot
ggplot(data = economics) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = unemploy))
# Side Note: you could have achieved the same result by mapping the variables in the ggplot() function rather than in geom_line():

# The Scatterplot
 
# The author of this chart was looking for a correlation between area and population.

# Use the "midwest" data from ggplot2
data("midwest", package="ggplot2")

head(midwest)

ggplot(data = midwest, aes(x = area, y = poptotal))+
  geom_point()

# Here’s version with some additional features

# The Density Plot

# Density plots are a great way to see how data is distributed. They are similar to histograms in a sense, but show values in terms of percentage of the total.

# Examine the mpg data set
head(mpg)
str(mpg)
glimpse(mpg)

g = ggplot(mpg, aes(cty))
g + geom_density(aes(fill = factor(cyl)), alpha = 0.8) +

       subtitle = "City Mileage Grouped by Number of cylinders",
       caption = "Source: mpg",
       x = "City Mileage",
       fill = "# Cylinders")

# How would you use your new knowledge to see the density by class instead of by number of cylinders? **Hint: ** g = ggplot(mpg, aes(cty)) has already been established.
g + geom_density(aes(fill = factor(class)), alpha = 0.8) +  
  labs(title = "Density plot",
       subtitle = "City Mileage Grouped by Number of class",
       caption = "Source: mpg",

# The Histogram

  labs(title = "Histogram",
       caption = "Source: mpg",
       x = "City Mileage")


# The Bar/Column Chart

# Data Preparation
freqtable <- table(mpg$manufacturer)
df <- as.data.frame.table(freqtable)
head(df)

#Set a theme

       caption = "Source: Frequency of Manufacturers from 'mpg' dataset") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 65, vjust = 0.6))

# You may also notice that ggplot arranged all of the data in alphabetical order based off of the manufacturer. If you want to change the order, it’s best to use the reorder() function. This next chart will use the Freq and coord_flip() to orient the chart differently.
g <- ggplot(df, aes(reorder(Var1,Freq), Freq))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, fill="tomato2") +

# Let's continue with bar charts - what if we wanted to see what hwy looked like by manufacturer and in terms of cyl?
g = ggplot(mpg,aes(x=manufacturer,y=hwy,col=factor(cyl),fill=factor(cyl)))
g + geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +
